- A guide to play testing
You could add, how to play, helpful hints. A guide to play testing (this may need some research to make a guide). And a link to the readme and contributions.
You could also find some tutorials or guides for coding in unity as resource links.

Here's what we had when playtesting. It's very rudimentary:
Instructions for Testing
Starting the Game:
To run the game, open up the downloaded Solitary folder, and click on Solitary.exe (see image below)
 
Controls:
Use either the left and right arrow keys or the ‘a’ and ‘d’ keys to move the character left and right respectively.  
Press ‘e’ to interact with in game objects like (puzzles, computers, doors, and ladders)

If you find a bug, or error:
Open the bug report document located in the same folder. 
For severity: 
• High: If the game crashes or it causes you to not be able to play the game
•       Medium: If there is a bug that doesn’t break the game but makes the game not enjoyable to play
•     Low:  Minor bug. Doesn’t affect gameplay. Or a cosmetic issue

Steps to reproduce: 
In order to fix an issue, we have to be able to see it ourselves. Try to reproduce the bug and what steps you did to cause it

Expected Results vs Actual Results
An Expected vs Actual result would be something like:
Ex. Jumping off a platform onto the ground. Expected: Player stops vertical movement when they reach the floor. Actual: Player continues through floor and clips through it. 

Images:
A picture is worth a 1000 words. (A video is worth even more)
If possible attach a picture of the bug to the report. This greatly helps the debugging and patching of the game. Use the link for instructions on how to use the Windows Snipping Tool.
