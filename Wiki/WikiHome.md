## Who can contribute?

Everyone can! (and I mean everyone)  
**You don’t have to contribute code**. Add a new asset, fix a typo, report a bug, add some documentation, do some re-design or add a translation. This project just like most open source projects are in need of all sorts of different contributions. Not just code.
